Notes on Battery Testing

Mock battery propreties are available for testing purposes.

The testing properties are DBus properties published on busname "com.canonical.indicator.power", object path "/com/canonical/indicator/power/Testing", and interface "com.canonical.indicator.power.Testing". The four properties are "MockBatteryEnabled" (boolean, default false), "MockBatteryLevel" (uint32 [0-100], default 50), "MockBatteryState" (string, default 'discharging'), "MockBatteryMinutesLeft" (minutes remaining to charge/discharge, uint32, default 30).

Example use:

Show the testing properties:

$ gdbus call --session --dest "com.canonical.indicator.power" \
             --object-path /com/canonical/indicator/power/Testing \
             --method org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.GetAll \
             com.canonical.indicator.power.Testing

Enable the mock battery:

$ gdbus call --session --dest "com.canonical.indicator.power" \
             --object-path /com/canonical/indicator/power/Testing \
             --method org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set \
             com.canonical.indicator.power.Testing \
             MockBatteryEnabled \
             "<true>"

Set the mock battery's charge to 10%

$ gdbus call --session --dest "com.canonical.indicator.power" \
             --object-path /com/canonical/indicator/power/Testing \
             --method org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Set \
             com.canonical.indicator.power.Testing \
             MockBatteryLevel \
             "<uint32 10>"

Test-case indicator-power/detect-charging-or-discharging
<dl>
    <dt>Begin with a discharging device</dt>
        <dd>The indicator's icon should denote a discharging battery; e.g. an icon without the 'âš¡' sign</dd>
    <dt>Plug it in so that its battery is charging</dt>
        <dd>The indicator's icon should change to show a charging battery</dd> 
    <dt>Unplug it again</dt>
        <dd>The indicator's icon should revert back to the same one in step one</dd>
</dl>

Test-case indicator-power/low-power-notifications
<dl>
    <dt>Wait for the system's battery level to drop to 10% (or fake it, see 'Notes on Battery Testing' above)</dt>
        <dd>A notification should appear</dd>
        <dd>Its title should read "Battery Low"</dd>
        <dd>Its text should read "10% charge remaining"</dd>
        <dd>The icon should be a low power icon</dd>
        <dd>It should have two actions, "Battery settings" and "OK". </dd>
    <dt>Tap OK to dismiss the popup</dt>
    <dt>Wait (or fake) the battery level to drop to 9%</dt>
        <dd>No new notification should appear -- we're still at the "Low" level </dd>
    <dt>Wait (or fake) the battery level to drop to 4%</dt>
        <dd>A notification should appear</dd>
        <dd>Its title should read "Battery Critical"</dd>
        <dd>Its text should read "4% charge remaining"</dd>
        <dd>The icon should be a critical power icon</dd>
        <dd>It should have two actions, "Battery settings" and "OK". </dd>
    <dt>Tap 'Battery Settings'</dt>
        <dd>ubuntu-system-settings should be launched to the Battery page </dd>
</dl>

Test-case indicator-power/low-power-icon
<dl>
    <dt>Wait for the system's battery level to drop to 21% (or fake it, see 'Notes on Battery Testing' above)</dt>
        <dd>The indicator's icon should use the non-critical coloring (eg, grey)</dd>
    <dt>Wait for the system's battery level to drop to 20% (or fake it, see 'Notes on Battery Testing' above)</dt>
        <dd>The indicator's icon should use the critical coloring (eg, red)</dd>
</dl>

Test-case indicator-power/device-brightness-slider
<dl>
    <dt>On a device, pull down the power indicator's menu</dt>
        <dd>The menu should include a brightness slider with icons</dd>
    <dt>Slide the brightness slider back and forth</dt>
        <dd>The screen should get brighter and darker in sync with the slider's position</dd>
    <dt>Launch unity-system-settings' Brightness panel</dt>
    <dt>Move both the indicator's and the settings panel's sliders</dt>
        <dd>Both sliders' positions should stay in sync with each other</dd>
        <dd>Both should have the same effect on the screen's brightness</dd>
    <dt>Make a note of the current brightness level and slider position</dt>
    <dt>Reboot the device</dt>
        <dd>The screen brightness should be the same as it was before rebooting</dd>
        <dd>The indicator's brightness slider should be in the same position as it was before rebooting</dd>
